Allow me to introduce myself. Hi, I'm Steve Price, and this be my site. It's been a long road to get this thing into a show-able state. But I went to art school so I know better than to bore you with details of 'my process'. Seriously, nobody gives a shit about that stuff.

Here are some fun facts about me: I'm a software developer living in New Orleans. I work as a contractor for a company called Surge Consulting. When coding, I'm happiest in JavaScript, but I also do .NET on the backend; so one's a love, the other's a livin'. Recently I've been trying to get in on a new language called Rust. It's pretty boss, that Rust Lang.

A lot of people ask me at parties how I got into coding. Funny you should ask! Cuz I'm totally not about to tell you that. I don't have time to get into that Freudian field day today. If you really want it, you'll just have to bother me for it.

I also do a lot of volunteer teaching with an organization here in NOLA called Operation Spark. OpSpark's mission is to teach opportunity youth in the GNO (that's Greater New Orleans, for all you tourists) legit coding skills. We start off at the high school level, and teach all the way up to the "lets' talk about compensation" level. It's a fairly young nonprofit, run by my friends John Fraboni and Max Gaudin. Don't tell them this, but they're kinda badasses. So I'll be talking about teaching the youts quite a bit.

Anyway, this gives me my obligatory 5 paragraphs according to the Standard Form Essay format. This proves I'm a sterling product of the American public school system. I'd give myself a B-minus today.
